"sailor_moon" icon in /icons/mob/human_face.dmi and it's shadow "sailor_moon+generic" in /icons/mob/hair_extensions.dmi 
were taken from goonstation's 2016 Build. They are covered under the goonstation license not the tgstation one - these icons were combined with the tgstation files
due to being unable to easily recode the hair into the /goon/icons/ directory.

See 

/goon/readme.md 

and 

/good/license.md 

for more details on the requirements of these items.
