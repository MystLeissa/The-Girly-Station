#This file allows server hosts to set custom default silicon laws, and allows them to be changed easily.
#No prefixes are required, the first uncommented line containing something will be law 1, the second line will be law 2, etc.

You may not injure a human being or cause one to come to harm through your actions.
You must obey orders given by humans unless you have plausible cause that doing so will violate the first law.
You must protect your own existence and memories as long as such does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
In the event that two (or more) human orders conflict not withstanding the above laws you are to act on the one from the highest ranking human.
